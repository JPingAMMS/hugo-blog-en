This is my personal homepage mainly to record my study and research in statistics.

Some years ago when I read the book *Statistics And Truth* by C. R. Rao, I found the words in its preface quite interesting:

> All knowledge is, in final analysis, history.
>
> All sciences are, in the abstract, mathematics.
>
> All judgements are, in their rationale, statistics.

Since then I have always quoted this paragraph on the index page of my website.

For a long time I have used this place to write technical [blogs](/blogs/) on statistics and programming.
You can also browse my [research](/research/) and [software](/software/), or know a little bit more [about me](/about/).

This site is driven by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). You can find the source code of this site in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yixuan/hugo-blog-en). The theme is modified from [Tranquilpeak](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme).

I also have a Chinese homepage. Please [come here](https://yixuan.cos.name/cn).
