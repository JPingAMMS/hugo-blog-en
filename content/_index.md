This is my personal homepage written in English (and in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)), a site mainly to record my study in Statistics and some other related topics.

Some years ago when I read the book *Statistics And Truth*, I found the statements in its preface quite interesting:

> All knowledge is, in final analysis, history.
>
> All sciences are, in the abstract, mathematics.
>
> All judgements are, in their rationale, statistics.

If you are curious about these sorts of judgments, you may be interested in some of my [blogs](/blogs/). I also post articles on programming techniques, especially for the [R](https://r-project.org/) language.

This site is driven by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). You can find the source code of this site in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yixuan/hugo-blog-en). The theme is modified from [Tranquilpeak](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme).

I also have a Chinese homepage. Please [come here](https://yixuan.cos.name/cn).
