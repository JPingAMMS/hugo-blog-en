![Purdue University](https://i.imgur.com/qaqnR.jpg "Purdue University")

I am Yixuan Qiu, a PhD student in
[Department of Statistics](http://www.stat.purdue.edu/), [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/).

My research focuses on statistical machine learning and inference. I have great interest
in statistical computing, large scale data analysis, and data visualization.
The [Projects](/projects/) page
lists some open source software and other projects that I have done.

I am pretty much a "useR", since R is so naturally connected with Statistics.
Apart from this, I also keep an eye on other open source projects and programming languages --
some of them are useful in statistical computing, and others are simply for fun.
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a nice place to find these stuffs,
and even this blog is open source in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yixuan/hugo-blog-en).

I graduated from [Renmin University of China](http://www.ruc.edu.cn/en), where I obtained B.A. and M.A. in
Statistics and Actuarial Science, respectively. There I stayed for six years in the city
of Beijing. That was a good memory.

You can always reach me through email, [yixuanq [at] gmail [dot] com](#). Feel free to send
me messages or leave comments here.
