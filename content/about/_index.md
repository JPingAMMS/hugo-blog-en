I am Yixuan Qiu, currently a postdoc at [Department of Statistics](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/),
[Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I obtained my PhD degree in statistics
from [Purdue University](http://www.stat.purdue.edu/) in 2018, and I graduated from
[Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en) for B.A. and M.A. in
statistics and actuarial science, respectively.

My research focuses on statistical machine learning and inference. I have great interest
in statistical computing, large-scale data analysis, deep learning, and data visualization.
You can find some of my works in the [Research](/research/) page.

I am also enthusiastic about programming and developing high-performance software packages
for statistics and machine learning. The [Software](/software/) page
lists some open source software packages that I have written and maintained over the years.
Feel free to stop by my [GitHub](https://github.com/yixuan/) page, and even better, give me a
star for projects that interest you.

I have been constantly (although slowly!) writing technical [blog posts](/blogs/) on statistics and programming.
Just leave a comment there if you have any thoughts on some topics.

You can always reach me through email, [yixuanq [at] gmail [dot] com](#).
